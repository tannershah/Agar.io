HOW TO PLAY:
Navigate to Main.java, and do one of the following:
-> If playing on 1 machine, run play(# desired players).
-> If using multiple machines, the server machine calls startServer(), then all client machines and server machine (if also playing) call startClient(). 

An ongoing server will be created and will only end when the server terminates
